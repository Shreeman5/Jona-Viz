# jona-visualization

The folder SunburstWithCircularTreemap contains visualizations that use the Sunburst and the Circular Treemap.

The folder SunburstWithRadialBar contains visualizations that use the Sunburst and the Radial Bar. This contains the BetaTesting model.

Once you clone the repository, open either folder with preferably, Visual Studio Code.

Additional information pertaining to each folder will be given in that folder's README.

Hosting the website on github:

Step 1: Under the 'Settings' tab of the repository, there is an option called 'Pages'. Click that.

Step 2: Under Branch, select the branch that you want to display. For instance, if latest code is in branch 'main', select 'main'.

Step 3: There is a select folder dropdown besides the branch dropdown. Choose /docs from there.

Step 4: Press save. 

Step 5: Refresh the page until there appears a text block at the top which says, "Your site is live at https://username.github.io/jona-visualization/" where username is the github username.

Step 6: Clicking that will show you this README file. In order to access one of the visualization folders(in total, 2), append the name of one of the folders and then append the html file name(which is sunburst.html) at the end of the address. 

So, for instance, if the name of the folder was 'SunburstWithCircularTreemap' and the name of the html file was 'sunburst.html', you will find that visualization at 'https://username.github.io/jona-visualization/SunburstWithCircularTreemap/sunburst.html'.

If the name of the folder was 'SunburstWithRadialBar' and the name of the html file was 'sunburst.html', you will find that visualization at 'https://username.github.io/jona-visualization/SunburstWithRadialBar/sunburst.html'.
